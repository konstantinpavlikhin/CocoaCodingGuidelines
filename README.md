## Dot syntax vs square brackets

Objects in Objective-C have properties and methods. Properties should be accessed via dot syntax and methods should be called via square brackets.

_**Note**: with every OS X release Apple updates API of its frameworks. Many things that were previously declared as a setter and getter methods gradually transition to a property declarations. Your source code should reflect these changes as they happen._

## Symbols prefixes

All classes, functions, enumerations and global constants (numbers, strings, notifications and so on...) should be prefixed with a three letters.

_*Hint*: for personal projects and reusable components consider using abbreviation of your name, middle name and a last name. When working for a client stick with abbreviation of a project name. Just make sure you pick one that sounds good._
